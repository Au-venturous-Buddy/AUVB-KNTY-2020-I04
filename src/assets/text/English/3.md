One good thing about Hanako though is that, while you wait for your order to be served, there is a sheet of paper placed on the table where you can answer puzzles such as a word search puzzle, a crossword puzzle on trivia questions about Japan, a tutorial on basic Japanese sentences and phrases, and even a Soduku puzzle!

<h3>Katsu Curry</h3>
Lastly, I tried the Katsu Curry of Hanako, one of its best-sellers. While the dish may look very big and generous, there are some serious pitfalls. Firstly, the breading of the tonkatsu is super-duper thick (that is, the proportion between the amount of pork and the amount of breading used is imbalanced by around a factor of 1:3). Also, there is a meager amount of potatoes and carrots. But then, of course, there is actually a silver lining: the golden curry sauce, which has the perfect balance of sweet and spicy! The bottom line is, despite its weaknesses, when all of these components come together in one bite, it tastes very divine!

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Hanako indeed adds a modern twist to your typical Japanese cuisine. The interiors are simple yet very modern, and their dishes come in very big (sometimes deceiving) sizes that are worth sharing with your companions. So if you are craving for modern Japanese cuisine and you want to share that passion with someone else, you may want to try this out! ðŸ™‚

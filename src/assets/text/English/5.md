<h3>Gyoza</h3>
The Gyozas at Hanako are slightly larger than other Japanese restaurants, but for me, are the most delicious so far. I can actually taste the usual meaty, gingery, and spring oniony flavor of a traditional gyoza, but what makes the gyozas at Hanako stand up from the rest is the broth that deepens the flavor profile (somewhat reminiscent of the xiao long baos in Chinese restaurants). It does go well with the black vinegar sauce!

By the way, Hanako has a Loyalty Card which you can use to claim freebies on your subsequent visits to Hanako, and both the Miso Soup and the Gyoza were among those freebies.

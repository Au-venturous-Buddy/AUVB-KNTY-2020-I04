<h3>Kosho Chicken</h3>
Hanako's Kosho Chicken is a rice bowl topped with bits of chicken simmered in a sweet sauce with green beans and mushrooms, and garnished with a side of buttered corn. And the taste of it makes this dish a good example of umami (something with no distinct taste yet is very flavorful). What I like most about this dish is actually the very thick sauce that adorns this rice bowl!

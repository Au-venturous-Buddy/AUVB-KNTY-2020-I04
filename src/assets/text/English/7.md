<h3>Katsudon</h3>
The Katsudon at Hanako may look like another Katsudon in any Japanese restaurant, but is way much more! Of course, there is the usual tonkatsu (breaded and deep-fried pork) that is simmered in a very sweet sauce and egg, but it's the vegetables (spring onions, onions, and carrots) that makes this dish stand out from the rest! When all of these ingredients are combined in one bite, it tastes very mild, sweet, and savory.

<h3>Miso Soup</h3>
Firstly, the Miso Soup at Hanako is, in many aspects, very similar to those of other Japanese Restaurants, with the familiar miso tastes that blends well with seaweed and tofu bits. But at Hanako, it is served in an unusually huge bowl (unlike in the case of other Japanese restaurants which serve Miso Soup only in a small bowl), so it's definitely good for sharing!
